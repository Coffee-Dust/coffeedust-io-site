      This was my first official programming endeavor. After reading through a few books about Swift and watching some YouTube tutorials, I finally got a good enough feel for the the Apple Swift language and went to work designing this game!<br/>
      I designed all of the graphics and art, even the soundtrack. <br/>
      It featured 1 playable game on released version, Meteoroids.<br/>
      <h4>Highlights of the 8-bit Master</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It featured an intuitive virtual game console interface</li>
        <li>This interface included virtual buttons and plus pad used to interact with what is displayed on the screen</li>
        <li>Allowed for multiple games to be loaded on there</li>
        <li>It had a store that allowed users to purchase in-game currency or watch an ad to earn it</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Meteoroids Features</h4>
      This game was modeled after classic arcade space shooter games.
      <ul>
        <li>It allowed the user to earn gold by shooting asteroids in space</li>
        <li>use that gold to purchase power-ups and use those power-ups during gameplay</li>
        <li>Let users make various upgrades to their gameplay over time</li>
      </ul>

        This project is a full SQL-less command-line interface database program. <br/>
        It is a full inventory software that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete data, as well as organize and categorize that data.
        <h4>Highlights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Intuitive command line interface.</li>
          <li>It converts those ruby objects into a JSON format and saves them to a JSON file.</li>
          <li>It can organize items into departments, categories and sub-categories.</li>
          <li>It also scrapes data from Publix to seed the database with sample data.</li>

        This was my first project in the world of Server Side web programming, as well as relational database design. It was built in the <a href="http://sinatrarb.com" target="_blank">Sinatra Domain Specific Language</a>, which is basically a â€˜less magicalâ€™ Rails framework.<br/>
        <h4>The Local Coffeeshop web app allows users to view:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Local coffeeshops in the area</li>
          <li>Review those coffeeshops</li>
          <li>View what drinks are the best</li>
        </ul>
        You can also keep track of your favorite coffeeshops, look at, revise, or delete your reviews!

      This is possibly my favorite project and the one I am most proud of. I actually use it personally quite a lot to hold various embeded music videos and radio streams from Youtube.<br/>
      It was actually built in pure ES6 Javascript in an object oriented fashion with a Ruby on Rails API server for data persistence.<br/>
      <h4>The My Coffee Table app allows users to: </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a virtual coffee tabletop</li>
        <li>Create various elements and place them on that coffee table</li>
        <li>Those elements can be Links, embeded content via iFrame, notes, pictures and more.</li>
        <li>Save and play youtube videos right on your coffee table</li>
        <li>Move those elements by dragging them around the table</li>
        <li>Customize those elements with preset styles and inline CSS</li>

        Coffee-Beans is basically a Twitter clone, with the original idea being being, only allowing posts about coffee
        This project idea was initially my Rails portfolio project(the repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/Coffee-Dust/Coffee-Beans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>), but I later decided to make a fork of this domain model and use it for my React portfolio project.<br/>
        On the rails side of things, I had to turn the domain model of the database into a more API friendly version. For the front end, as my original rails project was built using just ERB(embeded ruby) files, and no Javascript. I had to start from scratch on that front. <br/>
        <h4>Some Highlights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Post "beans" and view posts from different users</li>
          <li>React to those posts with multiple "reaction" options</li>
          <li>Comment on posts and react to them just like you can with posts</li>
          <li>Only post about coffee or get your account deleted ðŸ˜¬</li>

            Published iOS app/game that featured a classic gameboy-like interface and allowed users to play multiple 8-bit style games.
            Reengineered from the ground up, <em>Virtually 8-bit!</em> takes the concept (and some of the art) from my orginal ios game The 8-bit Master only it is 100% better in everyway.
          </p>
          <h4>Some Highlights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Engineered in a way that separates the Console's(app's) 'hardware' and 'software' systems. That allows for better code management and growth. I also built it in a way that allows code to be reused in multiple different games.</li>
            <li>Currently holds 2 playable games inside of it(more on the way), Meteoroids and Bit-Breaker. Meteoroids is an arcade space shooter that features power-ups and player upgradable abilities. Bit-Breaker is a breakout style game with randomly generated levels.</li>
            <li>It features SpriteKit as the physics engine, UIKit for handling 'virtual-analog' button touch events as well as all of the console's UI layout, and CloudKit for persisting user data when connected online, otherwise stores data locally until it can be synced.</li>
